          <p class="p">
            My upbringing was a symphony of cultures. Educated in Hong Kong, Canada, and the United States, I learned to
            speak multiple languages and navigate diverse perspectives. My parents, like CIS does for its students,
            instilled in me the values 仁, 義, 禮, 智, and 信. When I found a school upholding these same principles, I
            felt an instant connection. My journey, a tapestry woven from East and West, has nurtured my ability to
            build bridges, innovate, and solve problems not just for a single community, but for the global village we
            share. It is in a school filled with educators, students, and families who embrace these values that I long
            to collaborate with, to learn from, and to contribute my skills.
